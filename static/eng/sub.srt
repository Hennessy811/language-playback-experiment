1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,340
You both do have certain predispositions

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,380
that you're getting in the same way
in which people from political correctness

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,380
are trying to say this is
what it means to be a woman.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,780
These are the kind of things that it is

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,900
expected from a woman
to do to defend herself.

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,740
And it seems to me that you are making
a simple claim about this is what

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,600
conservative people do and this
is how they always relate to.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,820
Well, I don't I would say that I perhaps
am doing that, but I don't see how that's

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,940
the same as what
the postmodernists are doing.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,580
I mean, as far as I can tell,

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,580
the postmodernists aren't saying
that the groups, the individuals within

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,140
those groups are characterized by any
stable characteristics whatsoever except

13
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,100
for the fact of their
comparative oppression.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,140
So I don't understand the first
part of your argument.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,780
Part of the reason the postmodern types
have been going after me is because I

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:56,640
dared to say that men and women differ in
temperament, which, by the way, they do.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Now,
that's actually something that might be

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,020
worth just differentiating quickly because
it's actually

19
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,490
technically somewhat challenging
but also very much worth knowing.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,700
I was debating
someone on a panel this morning on a TV

21
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:25,490
show, The Right Stuff,
and this was a woman who led the female

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,460
the Women's Equality Party,
and she cited some psychological

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,930
literature that purported to claim
that men and women were mostly the same.

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,820
And that's actually true.

25
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,490
We are more the same than different.

26
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,820
If you look at our temperaments,

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,660
there's more overlap than there is
variance by a substantial amount.

28
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,720
And so even on the temperamental

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,620
dimensions where there is most difference
between men and women,

30
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:53,820
the difference isn't of massive magnitude
at the center of the distribution.

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,620
So for example, women are less aggressive

32
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,600
than men, which is, by the way,
why they commit suicide,

33
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,060
try to commit suicide more often, but are
much less lethal in their actions.

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,780
That's one example.
But there are many examples.

35
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,140
If you draw a random woman and a random
man out of the population,

36
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,780
the probability that the man
will be more aggressive is 60%.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,060
If you bet on the man,
you'd win 60% of the time.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,780
That's not a walloping difference.

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,820
It's not 95% of the time.

40
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,700
It's a difference that is substantive,
it's significant, it's measurable.

41
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,340
But it's not large by the standards
by which such things are judged.

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,220
But that's not the point.

43
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,100
The point is that most of the activity
takes place at the extremes.

44
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,340
So out on the tails of the distribution.

45
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,660
So here's an example.

46
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,580
About nine out of ten
people in prison are male.

47
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,780
Why?

48
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,260
Because to be in prison,

49
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,580
you have to be the most aggressive person,
let's say in 100, okay?

50
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,900
Those differences at the midpoint are

51
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,780
large enough so that if you go out
to the extremes, one in 100 people,

52
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,140
you have an overwhelming
preponderance of men.

53
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,300
And so you can have your
cake and eat it too.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,980
You can say, well, yeah, broadly speaking,

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,260
men and women are more
the same than different.

56
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,820
The overlap is greater than
the disjunction.

57
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,660
But that's not relevant if what's being

58
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,180
selected is often at the extremes,
and it often is.

59
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:21,020
So for example,

60
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,420
with regards to engineering,
there's a fair bit of evidence that people

61
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,700
who are more interested in things
than in people become engineers.

62
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,700
Now, that's not really going
to be what is that shocking?

63
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,940
Are you shocked by that?

64
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,980
You shouldn't be shocked by that, right?

65
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,500
You can you can tell that not only by what

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,060
engineers do, but you can
tell that by how they think.

67
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,500
And you can tell that just by talking
to them if you know a bunch of engineers.

68
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,580
And it turns out that the largest
temperamental difference that's known

69
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,660
between men and women is actually interest
in people versus interest in things.

70
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,180
And so it has nothing to do

71
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,900
with competence, but it has
a lot to do with interest.

72
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,860
And because you have to be very interested

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,760
in things to go be an engineer because
that's all you're going to be doing if

74
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,940
you're an engineer, then only those people
who are extremely interested in things

75
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,020
tend to become engineers
and most of them are men.

76
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,700
And that's why even in places like
Scandinavia, where a tremendous amount

77
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,500
of effort has been put into flattening
the sociocultural landscape

78
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,580
and successfully, by the way,
there's still a preponderance of male

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,660
engineers and there's
a preponderance of female nurses.

80
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,740
And no matter how much sociological
gerrymandering goes on,

81
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,260
those statistics have remained quite
intractable over about a 15 year period.

82
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,780
And so there are differences.

83
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,100
There are differences.

84
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,300
They're not massive.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,460
And then you might ask, well,
are those sociocultural or biological?

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,220
It's like well, that's a hard question
to answer because it depends on how much

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,860
variability there is
in the sociocultural landscape.

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,740
Because the proportion by which something

89
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:02,220
is biological versus sociocultural
varies with the sociocultural landscape.

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,260
That's a complicated thing to digest

91
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,140
because you think of those things
as fixed, but they're not.

92
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,420
But what we have demonstrated quite
clearly and this is mainstream science

93
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,820
despite the fact that people don't like
it, that this test has already been done.

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,460
So we developed a personality model that's
pretty stable across cultures,

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,980
purely derived from statistical
from statistical processes.

96
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,100
An atheoretical model if there ever was

97
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,500
one, and quite an unattractive
model because of that conceptually.

98
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,060
But that's beside the point.

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,820
Then we saw across culturally whether

100
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,780
there were differences in the fundamental
temperaments of men and women.

101
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,020
And the answer was yes.

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,860
Cross culturally, quite robust.

103
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,700
Women are higher in the experience

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,180
of anxiety and emotional pain and they're
more compassionate and agreeable.

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,540
Those are the big differences.

106
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,540
And there are differences of a magnitude
that I already pointed out.

107
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,460
Then the next question is, well,

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,020
to what degree is that biological
versus sociocultural?

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,580
And it's complicated because that variable
depends on the sociocultural landscape.

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,900
But we'll put that aside.

111
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,700
You can determine that by stacking up

112
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,840
countries from those who have
done everything they possibly can

113
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,380
to flatten out the sociocultural landscape
in relationship to gender,

114
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,300
to those who haven't that are
still very stratified by by sex.

115
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,580
And then what you do is you look

116
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,460
at the magnitude of the temperament
differences in keeping

117
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,460
with the variability that those countries
have in terms of their socio cultural

118
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:36,340
egalitarianism and the sociocultural
types, the social constructionists.

119
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,740
Their prediction is as cultures become

120
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,500
more egalitarian,
men and women become more different.

121
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,380
More the same.

122
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,220
Sorry, more the same
because it's environmental.

123
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,780
That isn't what happens exactly.

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,180
The opposite happens.

125
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,540
As you flatten out the sociocultural

126
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,980
landscape, men and women
become more different.

127
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,940
The data is in.

128
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,860
The experiment is done.

129
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,620
Tens of thousands of people,

130
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,540
multiple countries, and it's
not what anyone expected.

131
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,500
And you might think think, well,
it's all the right wing psychologists.

132
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:12,840
It's like all the right wing psychologists
are in this room, sitting in this chair.
